# Budget App ES5

My first project, written in JS ES5. Budget accepts submitted values of types **income** and **expense** and automatically calculates **total budget**. Simple as that :)

## Start

To see the final launched version of the project click the reference link above. In case you would like to launch the project onto your machine simply download the files and open index.html. 

## Summing Up 

* Learned how to *structure code* and keep it organized. Used a three modular build approach (**UI module**, **budget module** and **global module**), where UI module is responsible for User Interface, budget module does numbers manipulation behind the scenes and global module is the intermediate module establishing the connecting between UI and calculating modules. 
* As the code was written with ES5 version of JavaScript all three modules were constructed in **single budget-app.js file**. 
* While doing this project I got familiar with ** four core principles* of Object Oriented Programming such as
    * **encapsulation** expressed by *Immediately Invoked Function Expressions*. 
    * **Abstration** expressed by *closures*. 
    * **Inheritance** expressed by *constructors* and *constructor prototypes*. 
    * Finally, **polymorphism** expresse in combining functions with objects.
* Learned how to manipulate HTML objects and CSS characteristic using advanced JavaScript.

* Many thank to **Jonas**. My first online *Udemy teacher* for babysitting me :) and providing a great opportunity to practice the core set of JS skills, which helped me to build a strong foundation of me as a front-end developer.
